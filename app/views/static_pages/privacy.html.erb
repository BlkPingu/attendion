<h1>Privacy</h1>
<div>We are the good girls. We are not interested in your data at all: We won't collect it, so we can't sell it either.
  We don't even require your real name (or any name at all, although we all agree that it's nice to have one in your
  profile :) )
Why we still require you to sign up? We condemn any kind of trolling and inappropriate content and the only measure
which is powerful enough against harassment and bullying is being able to block users from our services.
If you have any other questions - feel free to approach us on Twitter and we'll get back to you:
